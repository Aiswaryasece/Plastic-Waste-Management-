Problem statement:

Due to wastage of plastic it causes air pollution, water pollution etc.
• Due to that it also affects the health of human begins and causes 
many health issues. Larger items, such as plastic bags and straws, can 
choke and starve marine life, while smaller fragments (micro plastics) can 
cause liver, reproductive, and gastrointestinal damage in animals.
• Secondly in forest region it affects animal’s life and growth of trees too
• The most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion, 
suffocation and entanglement of hundreds of marine species.
Marine wildlife such as seabirds, whales, fish and turtles 
mistake plastic waste for prey; most then die of starvation as 
their stomachs become filled with plastic
